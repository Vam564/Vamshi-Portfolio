<!--                         <p align="justify">I am a passionate software developer with a strong background in web
                            application development.
                            My journey in tech began back home in India, where my interest in building digital solutions
                            led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science.
                            After completing my master’s in the U.S., I started working as a Software Developer,
                            building and delivering web applications that solve real-world problems.
                            Along the way, I’ve always believed that learning is a never-ending process, and I embrace
                            the value of mistakes as stepping stones to success.</p>

                        <p align="justify">While I enjoy the challenges and growth opportunities in my full-time role, 
                            I’ve always harbored a dream to create something of my own. From a young age, 
                            I envisioned starting my own company, not confined to any particular industry. Recently, 
                            I took a step towards realizing that dream by founding <b>VK Global</b> with my wife <b>Keerthana</b>. We are building a leadership-driven business in the socio-commerce industry, aiming to create a lasting impact on people's lives. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Balancing my entrepreneurial pursuits with my full-time job, I’m committed to building a future where we break free from the traditional 9-5 path. Through continuous learning and leadership, 
                            I strive to build a business that drives personal and collective growth.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">
I’m a highly motivated <b>Full-Stack Developer</b> with over <b>5</b> years of hands-on experience building responsive, scalable, 
                          and user-centric web applications. My background spans across dynamic environments—from enterprise 
                          software at Paycom and Cognizant to independently building innovative full-stack projects like Cricket Fever, 
                          a live cricket streaming platform, and QuickTrailer, a multilingual media discovery app. With a solid foundation in React, 
                          Node.js, PostgreSQL, cloud services, and modern CI/CD practices, I’ve designed robust microservices, developed secure ETL pipelines, 
                          and integrated generative AI models into real-world applications. My technical journey has been fueled by a deep interest in combining 
                          usability with performance, 
                          and I continuously explore ways to push the boundaries of what software can do
                        </p>

                      <p align="justify">
                        What sets me apart is not just the code I write, but the mindset I bring—collaborative, curious, and solution-focused. 
                        I thrive in team settings where ideas are shared freely, and where mentoring, cross-functional communication, and agile practices are valued. I take pride in translating complex challenges into maintainable, scalable solutions that drive tangible business outcomes. Whether it’s improving user experience, accelerating deployments, or integrating new technologies, 
                        I’m committed to contributing to a culture of innovation and to the success of the team and organization I’m part of.
