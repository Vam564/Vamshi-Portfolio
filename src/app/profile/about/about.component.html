                        <p align="justify">I am a passionate software developer with a strong background in web
                            application development.
                            My journey in tech began back home in India, where my interest in building digital solutions
                            led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science.
                            After completing my master’s in the U.S., I started working as a Software Developer,
                            building and delivering web applications that solve real-world problems.
                            Along the way, I’ve always believed that learning is a never-ending process, and I embrace
                            the value of mistakes as stepping stones to success.</p>

                        <p align="justify">While I enjoy the challenges and growth opportunities in my full-time role, 
                            I’ve always harbored a dream to create something of my own. From a young age, 
                            I envisioned starting my own company, not confined to any particular industry. Recently, 
                            I took a step towards realizing that dream by founding <b>VK Global</b> with my wife <b>Keerthana</b>. We are building a leadership-driven business in the socio-commerce industry, aiming to create a lasting impact on people's lives. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Balancing my entrepreneurial pursuits with my full-time job, I’m committed to building a future where we break free from the traditional 9-5 path. Through continuous learning and leadership, 
                            I strive to build a business that drives personal and collective growth.
                        </p>
